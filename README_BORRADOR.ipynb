    "Well, time is what it is. It might be a continuous phenomena, as a universal wave that is composed of individual packets of information or \"monads\". If you read about the idea of phonons, and then about the idea of photons all makes more sense. Vibrational energy typically needs a medium we feel familiar with, like air, electro-magnetic waves do not need (In principle) a medium to propagate, it's said they propagate through another mathematical object called space-time. \n",
    "\n",
    "So waves propagate through a Galilean space time. I'm not a physicist , so I'd love to be corrected by someone that really knows about these things. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's useful to imagine monads as dynamic mirrors that produce a specific set of musical notes for every place of space and happening during an unimaginable fast and powerful set of Time's quartz ticks. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we write Time we mean the ontological entity we are playing as a character in our Math fan fiction story, but moments of time are just snapshots of whatever is happening from the micro scales to the large scales of the toy universe. \n",
    "\n",
    "It depends on what we are looking at, if we are interested on the energy of a process, or it's biological evolution, or maybe just play in the most general way, the group theory way, and let math and it's symmetries guide you through the physical intuitions you can't completely grasp, and would produce brain overflow if every ad-hoc application of symmetry is thought at the same time.\n",
