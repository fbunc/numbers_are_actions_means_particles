When we see a number of things together, one becomes aware of this order among them...\"\n",

    " Landauer's principle states that the minimum energy needed to erase one bit of information is proportional to the temperature at which the system is operating. Specifically, the energy needed for this computational task is given by:\n",

    " $$E\\geq k_BT\\ln(2)$$\n",
    "\n",
    " $E$ is the energy in Joules that is needed to erase one bit of information, is a theoretical lower bound. $k_B$ is the ubiquitous Boltzmann constant, $T$ here will be the temperature of the system in Kelvin, and the logarithm is there to remind us we are relating energy to base two representation of **information**. I'd love to completely understand how he arrived to this idea. So here we go. \n",

    " We are going to explore if it's possible to see this principle emerge from first principles. I won't be the one to judge if the presented exploration achieves that, it's just a fun horizon to imagine. Maybe it takes me many years to finally explain it to myself properly, but the emergence of these ideas is there, we just have to describe it. \n",

    "\n",
    "If we imagine the creation of the toy-universe as a process where there was some kind of \"relationship\" between two metaphysical entities we are going to use as main characters in our math fan fiction story , where one is Time as the fundamental structure where everything lives.Time is the precursor of motion and energy in this toy-universe model. \n",

    "## Rationality and periodicity - Continuos Time or Discrete time?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, time is what it is. It might be a continuous phenomena, as a universal wave that is composed of individual packets of information or \"monads\". If you read about the idea of phonons, and then about the idea of photons all makes more sense. Vibrational energy typically needs a medium we feel familiar with, like air, electro-magnetic waves do not need (In principle) a medium to propagate, it's said they propagate through another mathematical object called space-time. \n",
    "\n",
    "So waves propagate through a Galilean space time. I'm not a physicist , so I'd love to be corrected by someone that really knows about these things. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's useful to imagine monads as dynamic mirrors that produce a specific set of musical notes for every place of space and happening during an unimaginable fast and powerful set of Time's quartz ticks. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we write Time we mean the ontological entity we are playing as a character in our Math fan fiction story, but moments of time are just snapshots of whatever is happening from the micro scales to the large scales of the toy universe. \n",
    "\n",
    "It depends on what we are looking at, if we are interested on the energy of a process, or it's biological evolution, or maybe just play in the most general way, the group theory way, and let math and it's symmetries guide you through the physical intuitions you can't completely grasp, and would produce brain overflow if every ad-hoc application of symmetry is thought at the same time.\n",

    "$T_o$ completely governs the behavior of $\\omega$ and can be interpreted as restricted by our sampling frequency $f_s=1/T_s$\n",
    "\n",

    "### Nyquist Shannon Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "If we satisfy a **sufficient** condition given by Nyquist Shannon Theorem, we can safely assume in ideal conditions that we are able to avoid aliasing using a sampling frequency at least two times larger than the highest frequency present in the sampled signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Claude S. taught us that if $f_s\\geq 2f$ we have a sufficient amount of samples to be able to reconstruct $\\theta^t$ from our sampled $\\omega^n$ function without aliasing. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\theta^{nT_s}=\\omega^{n}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sufficient** means that the Theorem says nothing about particular cases where using $f_s>kf$ for a positive $k \\leq 1$ might produce results where reconstruction is still possible. This idea is used in MRI technology for example, in radial sampling scenarios where sparsity becomes important as a parameter defining the sampling period. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So what about the periodicity of the continuos time function and the related discrete time sequence? \n",
    "\n",

    "$$\\omega^{n+P}=\\omega^{n}\\omega^{P}=\\omega^n$$\n",

    "\n",
    "$$T_o=\\frac{T}{T_s}=\\frac{f_s}{f}=\\frac{p}{q}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So the period $P$ has to be restricted by the selection of the following parameters being $k,k_o \\in \\mathbb{Z}$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\omega^{P}=\\omega^{k_oT_o}=e^{2 \\pi ik}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P=k_o T_o$$\n",

    "\n",
    "$$p=q\\frac{f_s}{f}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So we have this simple conclusion, the periods of the discrete time sequence are multiples of $p$ if we assume $T/T_s$ and $f_s/f$ to be  rational numbers. But $f$ might not be rational, or the selected sampling frequency could have components that make it drift over time, so we might want an integer value for $f_s$ but not achieve-it in reality. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The drifting of the irrationals\n",
    "\n",
    "If we imagine a case where $T$ is not a rational number, the discrete time sequence will lose it's classical periodicity, if we try to approximate the effect, we will see drifting $\\text{m-gons}$ on each subsequent orbit not quite going back to the same phase . \n",
    "\n",
    "But if you wait long enough and choose the right perspective, you start to see the almost periodicity emerge. \n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing the right parameters we can sync an irrational to make it correspond for a selected scale to an integer we will call $M_c$\n",
    "\n",
    "I've been told by more than one mathematician that I can prove this, but I'm not sure what they mean. I'm not familiar with doing mathematical proofs. \n",
    "\n",

    "We use the color as a simple way to encode 3 extra dimensions given by the hue, saturation and value , or the red, green and blue components of the representation. So in these examples we can imagine the color following a function proportional to Time's most simple evolution, or as symbols coming from a roulette wheel with $M$ slots you need to organize in time because you suspect there might be some \"almost-periodicity\" associated to that set of symbols you are receiving, you know they are not real roulette long term sets of data, they look like roulette but finally you discover they follow an specific pattern like for example:\n",
